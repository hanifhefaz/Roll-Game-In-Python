# LUCKY ROLL

WHAT WILL BE YOUR HIGHEST BALANCE? TRY IT HERE!

You can set your main balance at first run. in the second box you can set your bet amount, and in the third box you can set your lucky number. Then you have to select wethere the generated number will be greater or smaller than your lucky number.

## Rules

- if you select your lucky number 10, and you have selected that the generated number will be greater than 10, then two cases exist:
1. if generated comes greater than 10 then your bet amount will be multiplied by 1.1 and the amount will be added to your balance. This rule applies to 20,30,40,50,60,70,80 and 90 with same way, and the multiplier will also increase by 0.10. for example if you slect 60 as your lucky number and you have selected that the generated number will be greater than 60, and it comes so, than your bet amont will be multiplied by 1.6 and so on.
2. second case that if generated numbers comes smaller than 10, then you will only lose the bet amount multiplied by 1.1 and reduced from your account. this amount will increase if you select higher numbers as your lucky numbers!

- if you select your lucky number 10, and you have selected that the generated number will be smaller than 10, then again two cases exist: 

1. if generated number comes smaller than 10 then, your bet amount will be multiplied by 2 and the amount will be added to your balance. This rules applies to 20,30,40,50,60,70,80 and 90 with same way, but the multiplier will decrease by 0.10. for example if you slect 60 as your lucky number and you have selected that the generated number will be smaller than 60, and it comes so, than your bet amont will be multiplied by 1.4 and so on.
2. if generated number comes greater than 10 then you will only lose the bet amount multiplied by 1.1 and reduced from your account. this amount will increase if you select higher numbers as your lucky numbers!


## How to run
**game.py** is command line implementation of the game, while **main.py** is GUI implementation. download the files to your computer and run them locally. 

You can download the **main.exe** file into your windows OS and run it locally.

## Future Work
add win and lose percentage for each number from 0 to 99.
currently, this is working only on defined percentages.

Plus adding a good GUI, which show all the numbers from 0 to 99 and the users will be able to select bet amount from there.
